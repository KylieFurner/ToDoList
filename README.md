# Overview

This was my first ever web app and was a great first project. I followed a tutorial and still added some debugging. This project taught me how to use django, the functions of apps and projects and how to use and create a virtual environment.

The web app I created is a To Do List. You can create or delete lists and add or delete items. The test server I used was django and opening the app and running the program creates a link 

I wanted to write this software because it alligned with my interests. I always feel like I am losing track of the things I have to do!

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

There is the main web page that displays your lists, if you select a list it will show you all the items in the list, there are two more pages for creating and deleting a list or item. And there is the additional http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ which allows a super admin to login

# Development Environment

I used django, python and html to develop this software. django has many libraries such as reverse, and timezone.
